# SOCKET CHAT APP using ReactJS and NodeJS


This is a chat app that I built using Socket.io, React and NodeJS. 
Socket.IO is a library that enables low-latency, bidirectional and event-based communication between a client and a server.
It is built on top of the WebSocket protocol and provides additional guarantees like fallback to HTTP long-polling or automatic reconnection.
